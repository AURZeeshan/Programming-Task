# Visitor Management Application

This repository contains a simple Flask application that interacts with a MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS. It provides endpoints to add visitors' names to the database and retrieve a list of all visitors.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Install necessary Python packages:
  ```sh
  pip install flask pymysql

### Summary

These deliverables include the source code of the Flask application (`app.py`), unit tests for the application (`tests/test_app.py`), and a `README.md` file explaining how to set up and run the application, as well as how to run the tests using `pytest`. Adjust the placeholders (`<RDS_ENDPOINT>`, `<repository-url>`, `<repository-name>`) with your actual values and paths.
